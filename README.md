"The challenge was to design a system that allows users to upload datasets, define custom queries, and retrieve specific information for entities like companies or individuals. My solution uses an AI agent that performs web searches for each entity, processes the results using a language model, and structures the output into an easily downloadable format. Itâ€™s efficient, scalable, and user-friendly."
